# Editable Source Code
- Only modify source code in `src/`, `yaml-sh/`, and `lib/` directories
- Do NOT edit `ticket.sh` in project root directly - it's generated by `build.sh`

# Testing
- After modifying code, run `test/run-all.sh` and `test/run-all-on-docker.sh` before reporting to user. Fix any errors.
- If existing code has errors, create an error-fixing ticket and work on it after completing current task.

# Ticket Management Instructions

Use `./ticket.sh` for ticket management. When receiving requests from users, create tickets and perform work within tickets. Even small user requests should be documented in `current-ticket.md` while progressing.

## Create New Ticket

1. Create ticket: `./ticket.sh new feature-name`
2. Edit ticket content and description in the generated file

## Start Working on Ticket

1. Check available tickets: `./ticket.sh list` or browse tickets directory
2. Start work: `./ticket.sh start 241225-143502-feature-name`
3. Develop on feature branch (current-ticket.md shows active ticket)

## Ticket Closing

1. Before closing:
   - Review ticket content and description
   - Check all tasks in checklist are completed (mark with `[x]`)
   - Get user approval before proceeding
2. Complete: `./ticket.sh close`

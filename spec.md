# Ticket Management System Specification: ticket.sh

## üéØ Purpose

A self-contained ticket management system using a single shell script + files + Git

- **Coding Agent Progress Management**: Primary purpose is managing Coding Agent work progress
- **Fully Self-Contained**: No external services or databases required
- **Git Flow Compliant**: Based on develop, feature/* branch structure
- **Simple Operations**: Ticket management with Markdown + YAML Front Matter

---

## üöÄ System Overview

### Ticket Management Mechanism

#### Ticket Name
- Ticket name format: `YYMMDD-hhmmss-<slug>`
- Used as base for filenames and branch names

#### File-Based Management
- Complete ticket in single file: `tickets/<ticket-name>.md`
- Metadata stored in YAML Front Matter section
- Ticket details written in Markdown body section

#### Minimal YAML Configuration
```yaml
priority: 2
description: ""
started_at: null  # Do not modify manually
closed_at: null   # Do not modify manually
```

#### State Management
- **todo**: `started_at` is null
- **doing**: `started_at` is set and `closed_at` is null
- **done**: `closed_at` is set

#### Branch Integration
- Work performed on `feature/<ticket-name>` branches
- Current work ticket visualization via current-ticket.md

---

## üìñ Usage

### Initialize
```bash
./ticket.sh init
```
Generates required directories, configuration files, and .gitignore entries

### Create Ticket
```bash
./ticket.sh new <slug>
```
Creates empty ticket file, then edit to add title, description, and details

### Start Work
```bash
# Execute from default_branch
./ticket.sh start <ticket-file>
```
- Switches to corresponding feature branch
- Creates symlink to current-ticket.md
- Reference current-ticket.md while developing

### Restore Link
```bash
./ticket.sh restore
```
Auto-restores from branch name when current-ticket.md is lost after clone/pull

### Complete Work
```bash
./ticket.sh close <ticket-file>
```
- Squashes commits for organization
- Merges to default_branch
- Updates ticket status to completed

### List View
```bash
./ticket.sh list [--status todo|doing|done]
```
Displays ticket status list (default: todo+doing)

---

## üìÅ Directory Structure

## üß≠ Command List

```bash
./ticket.sh init                          # Initialize
./ticket.sh new <slug>                    # Create ticket (slug: lowercase, numbers, hyphens only)
./ticket.sh list [--status todo|doing|done] [--count N]  # List tickets
./ticket.sh start <ticket-name> [--no-push]  # Start ticket/create branch
./ticket.sh restore                       # Restore current-ticket link
./ticket.sh close [--no-push] [--force|-f]  # Complete ticket/merge process
```

---

## üìù Ticket File Structure

### Filename Format (Fixed)
```
YYMMDD-hhmmss-<slug>.md
Example: 240628-153245-create-post-handler.md
```

### YAML Front Matter
```yaml
---
priority: 2
tags: []
description: ""
created_at: "2025-06-28 15:32:45 UTC"
started_at: null
closed_at: null
---

# Ticket Title

Ticket details...
```

### State Determination Logic
- **todo**: `started_at` is null
- **doing**: `started_at` is set and `closed_at` is null  
- **done**: `closed_at` is set

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Command Specifications

### Common Error Cases
All commands perform these prerequisite checks:

**Required Conditions:**
- `.git` directory exists: 
  ```
  Error: Not in a git repository
  This directory is not a git repository. Please:
  1. Navigate to your project root directory, or
  2. Initialize a new git repository with 'git init'
  ```
- `.ticket-config.yml` exists: 
  ```
  Error: Ticket system not initialized
  Configuration file '.ticket-config.yml' not found. Please:
  1. Run 'ticket.sh init' to initialize the ticket system, or
  2. Navigate to the project root directory where the config exists
  ```

---

### `init`
Performs system initialization:

1. Creates `.ticket-config.yml` with default values (if not exists)
2. Creates `{tickets_dir}/` directory
3. Creates `.gitignore` file (if not exists) and adds `current-ticket.md` (with duplicate check)

**Note**: This command only skips configuration file existence check

**Error Cases:**
- Not a git repository: 
  ```
  Error: Not in a git repository
  This directory is not a git repository. Please:
  1. Navigate to your project root directory, or
  2. Initialize a new git repository with 'git init'
  ```
- No directory creation permission: 
  ```
  Error: Permission denied
  Cannot create directory '{tickets_dir}'. Please:
  1. Check file permissions in current directory, or
  2. Run with appropriate permissions (sudo if needed), or
  3. Choose a different location for tickets_dir in config
  ```

### `new <slug>`
Creates a new ticket:

- **slug constraints**: Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-) allowed
- Filename: `{tickets_dir}/YYMMDD-hhmmss-<slug>.md`
- Auto-inserts initial YAML Front Matter values
- Sets current time (ISO 8601 UTC) to `created_at`
- Inserts `default_content` from config to Markdown body
- Displays edit prompt message on completion

**Example:**
```bash
./ticket.sh new implement-auth
# Output: Created ticket file: tickets/240628-153245-implement-auth.md
#         Please edit the file to add title, description and details.
```

**Error Cases:**
- File already exists: 
  ```
  Error: Ticket already exists
  File '{filename}' already exists. Please:
  1. Use a different slug name, or
  2. Edit the existing ticket, or
  3. Remove the existing file if it's no longer needed
  ```
- No file creation permission: 
  ```
  Error: Permission denied
  Cannot create file '{filename}'. Please:
  1. Check write permissions in tickets directory, or
  2. Run with appropriate permissions, or
  3. Verify tickets directory exists and is writable
  ```
- Invalid slug: 
  ```
  Error: Invalid slug format
  Slug '{slug}' contains invalid characters. Please:
  1. Use only lowercase letters (a-z)
  2. Use only numbers (0-9)  
  3. Use only hyphens (-) for separation
  Example: 'implement-user-auth' or 'fix-bug-123'
  ```

**Generated Example:**
```yaml
---
priority: 2
tags: []
description: ""  # single line
created_at: "2025-06-28T15:32:45Z"
started_at: null  # Do not modify manually
closed_at: null   # Do not modify manually

### `list [--status todo|doing|done] [--count N]`
Displays ticket list:

- **Default**: Shows only `todo` and `doing` without `--status` specification
- **Default count**: `--count 20` (configurable)
- **Sort order**: Evaluated by `status` ‚Üí `priority`
- State auto-determined from datetime fields

**Display Format:**
```yaml
üìã Ticket List
---------------------------
- status: doing
  ticket_name: 240628-153221-create-post-handler
  description: User authentication POST handler
  priority: 1
  created_at: 2025-06-27T10:30:00Z

  ```
  Error: Tickets directory not found
  Directory '{tickets_dir}' does not exist. Please:
  1. Run 'ticket.sh init' to create required directories, or
  2. Check if you're in the correct project directory, or
  3. Verify tickets_dir setting in .ticket-config.yml
  ```
- Invalid status specification: 
  ```
  Error: Invalid status

  - todo (for unstarted tickets)
  - doing (for in-progress tickets)  
  - done (for completed tickets)
  ```
- Invalid count value: 
  ```
  Error: Invalid count value
  Count '{count}' is not a valid number. Please:

  2. Or omit --count to use default (20)
  ```

### `start <ticket-name> [--no-push]`
Starts ticket work:

1. Sets current time to specified ticket's `started_at`
2. Creates Git branch as `{branch_prefix}<basename>`
3. Creates symlink to `current-ticket.md`
4. **Push control**: Executes `git push -u {repository} <branch>` only when `auto_push: true` and `--no-push` not specified
5. Displays executed Git commands and output in detail

**File Specification Flexibility:**
```bash
# All specify the same ticket
./ticket.sh start tickets/240628-153245-foo.md  # Full path
./ticket.sh start 240628-153245-foo.md         # Filename
./ticket.sh start 240628-153245-foo            # Ticket name

```
Ticket Management System for Coding Agents

OVERVIEW:
This is a self-contained ticket management system using shell script + files + Git.
Each ticket is a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter metadata.

USAGE:
  ./ticket.sh init                     Initialize system (create config, directories, .gitignore)
  ./ticket.sh new <slug>               Create new ticket file (slug: lowercase, numbers, hyphens only)
  ./ticket.sh list [--status STATUS] [--count N]  List tickets (default: todo + doing, count: 20)
  ./ticket.sh start <ticket-name> [--no-push]     Start working on ticket (creates feature branch)
  ./ticket.sh restore                  Restore current-ticket.md symlink from branch name
  ./ticket.sh close [--no-push]       Complete current ticket (squash merge to default branch)

TICKET NAMING:
- Format: YYMMDD-hhmmss-<slug>
- Example: 241225-143502-implement-user-auth
- Generated automatically when creating tickets

TICKET STATUS:
- todo: not started (started_at: null)
- doing: in progress (started_at set, closed_at: null)
- done: completed (closed_at set)

CONFIGURATION:
- Config file: .ticket-config.yml (in project root)
- Initialize with: ./ticket.sh init
- Edit to customize directories, branches, and templates

PUSH CONTROL:
- Set auto_push: false in config to disable automatic pushing
- Use --no-push flag to override auto_push: true for single command
- Git commands and outputs are displayed for transparency

WORKFLOW:
1. Create ticket: ./ticket.sh new feature-name
2. Edit ticket content and description
3. Start work: ./ticket.sh start 241225-143502-feature-name
4. Develop on feature branch (current-ticket.md shows active ticket)
5. Complete: ./ticket.sh close

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Run from project root (where .git and .ticket-config.yml exist)
- Use 'restore' if current-ticket.md is missing after clone/pull
- Check 'list' to see available tickets and their status
- Ensure Git working directory is clean before start/close

Note: current-ticket.md is git-ignored and needs 'restore' after clone/pull.
```

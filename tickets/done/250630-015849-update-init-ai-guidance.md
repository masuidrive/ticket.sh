# Update init command AI guidance message

Update the init command's AI coding assistant section to:
1. Emphasize adding instructions to existing AI configuration files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, etc.)
2. Clearly state that these instructions are important and should be shown to users

## Tasks
- [x] Update the message to say "Add to your AI agent's configuration file"
- [x] Add emphasis that these instructions are important
- [x] Build and test the changes

## Notes
User feedback: The current message suggests creating new files, but it should emphasize adding to existing AI configuration files instead.

# Fix Success Message Defaults and Add Tests

Fix regression where start_success_message default was changed from useful message to empty, and add comprehensive tests for all success message functionality.

## Tasks

- [ ] Restore start_success_message default to original value to preserve existing behavior
- [ ] Keep new_success_message and restore_success_message defaults as empty (new features)
- [ ] Update config template to show correct defaults
- [ ] Create comprehensive test for success message functionality
- [ ] Test all four success messages (new, start, restore, close)
- [ ] Test empty vs non-empty message behavior
- [ ] Test multiline message support
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with existing configs
- [ ] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions)
- [ ] Run `bash build.sh` to build the project
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Notes

**Problem identified:**
- Original `start_success_message` had helpful default: "Please review the ticket content..."
- Changed to empty string, breaking existing user experience
- No tests added for new success message functionality

**Requirements:**
- Preserve existing behavior for start_success_message
- New features (new_success_message, restore_success_message) should default to empty
- Add comprehensive test coverage for all success message types
- Ensure backward compatibility

# Fix macOS bash 3.2.57 Compatibility Issues for Test Suite

Fix critical compatibility issues with macOS default bash 3.2.57 that were causing test suite hanging and failures, preventing CI deployment.

## Tasks

- [x] Fix process substitution issues in yaml-sh.sh causing hanging
- [x] Add stdin redirection to prevent interactive bash mode
- [x] Fix all test hanging issues (test-basic, test-check, test-config-file-detection)
- [x] Update all test files to use main branch instead of develop
- [x] Fix grep errors in test files for moved ticket files
- [x] Add macOS compatibility documentation to run-all.sh
- [x] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions) - ACHIEVED 156/156 PASS
- [x] Run `bash build.sh` to build the project
- [x] Get developer approval before closing

## Notes

**Problem**: macOS ships with bash 3.2.57 which has compatibility issues:
1. Process substitution `< <()` causes hanging in yaml-sh.sh
2. Commands entering interactive mode without stdin redirection
3. Test files expecting "develop" branch but using "main"

**Solution implemented**:
1. Replace process substitution with temporary files
2. Add `</dev/null` to all init/list commands 
3. Update all branch references from develop â†’ main
4. Add comprehensive documentation

**Result**: 100% test pass rate (156/156) achieved for CI deployment.

## Progress Notes

- 2025-07-15: Identified root cause - bash 3.2.57 process substitution and interactive mode issues
- 2025-07-15: Fixed yaml-sh.sh process substitution by using temporary files
- 2025-07-15: Added stdin redirection from /dev/null to all init/list commands
- 2025-07-15: Updated all test files to use main branch instead of develop
- 2025-07-15: Fixed grep errors checking closed tickets in wrong locations
- 2025-07-15: Added comprehensive documentation to run-all.sh
- 2025-07-15: Successfully achieved 156/156 test pass rate - all issues resolved

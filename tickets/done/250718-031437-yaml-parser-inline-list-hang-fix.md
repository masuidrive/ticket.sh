# Fix YAML Parser Inline List Hang Issue

## Overview

Fix critical bug where YAML parser hangs indefinitely when processing inline list syntax (`tags: ["item1", "item2"]`) in bash 5.1+ environments, causing ticket.sh close command to freeze.

## Problem Analysis

**Current Issue:**
- `./ticket.sh close` hangs indefinitely in bash 5.1+ environments
- Debug trace shows hanging in YAML parser's inline list processing
- Specifically fails on syntax: `tags: ["error-handling", "backend", "frontend", "api", "ux"]`
- Works fine with block list syntax (multi-line with dashes)

**Root Cause:**
- yaml-sh.sh YAML parser has performance/infinite loop issue with inline list (`ILIST`) processing
- Affects bash 5.1.16+ environments (confirmed in Codespaces)
- The parser correctly identifies inline list items but gets stuck in processing loop

**Evidence:**
```bash
+ echo 'ILIST 0 error-handling'
+ echo 'ILIST 0 backend'
# Hangs here - never completes processing
```

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Investigation and Reproduction
- [x] Create minimal reproduction case for YAML inline list hang
- [x] Test yaml-sh.sh parser in isolation with problematic input
- [x] Identify exact line in _yaml_parse_awk causing infinite loop
- [x] Test bash version compatibility (3.2, 4.x, 5.1+)

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation  
- [x] Fix inline list processing logic in yaml-sh/yaml-sh.sh
- [x] Ensure compatibility with both inline and block list syntax
- [x] Optimize performance for large inline lists
- [x] Add timeout mechanism for YAML parsing operations

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [x] Test with various inline list formats:
  - `tags: ["item1", "item2"]`
  - `tags: ["item1", "item2", "item3", "item4", "item5"]`
  - `tags: []` (empty list)
- [x] Test with mixed YAML content (inline lists + other content)
- [x] Verify backward compatibility with existing ticket files
- [x] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

### Phase 4: Prevention and Documentation
- [x] Add test cases for inline list syntax to test suite
- [x] Document YAML syntax recommendations in README
- [ ] Add validation/warning for problematic YAML syntax (optional future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider adding YAML syntax converter (inline → block) (optional future enhancement)

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
- [x] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions)
- [x] Run `bash build.sh` to build the project
- [x] Test in multiple bash environments (macOS 3.2, Linux 4.x, Linux 5.1+)
- [x] Verify fix works in user's Codespaces environment (user confirmed)
- [x] Get developer approval before closing

## Acceptance Criteria

- `./ticket.sh close` completes successfully with inline list syntax in tags
- No performance degradation for normal YAML processing
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing ticket files
- Works across all supported bash versions (3.2 - 5.1+)

## Test Cases

1. **Inline List Processing**:
   - Input: `tags: ["error-handling", "backend", "frontend"]`
   - Expected: Parses without hanging, returns correct values

2. **Empty Inline List**:
   - Input: `tags: []`
   - Expected: Parses correctly as empty list

3. **Mixed Syntax Support**:
   - Both `tags: ["a", "b"]` and `tags:\n  - a\n  - b` work identically

4. **Performance Test**:
   - Large inline list (10+ items) processes in reasonable time (<2 seconds)

## Notes

**Priority: High** - This is a critical bug blocking basic ticket.sh functionality for users in modern bash environments.

**User Impact**: 
- Makes ticket.sh unusable in Codespaces and modern Linux environments
- Forces users to manually edit YAML syntax to work around issue
- Affects close command which is core functionality

**Environment Details**:
- Confirmed failing in: bash 5.1.16 (Codespaces)
- Working in: bash 3.2.57 (macOS)
- ticket.sh version: 20250717.084942

## Progress Notes

**Issue Identification**: 
- Created minimal reproduction cases to isolate the problem to yaml-sh.sh:yaml_parse function
- Confirmed AWK parser works correctly - issue was in bash file processing loop
- Issue was bash 5.1+ compatibility with file descriptor handling

**Root Cause**: 
- Line 301: `while IFS='' read -r line; do` wasn't handling edge cases properly in bash 5.1+
- Line 376: File descriptor syntax `exec {fd}<&-` not compatible with bash 3.2

**Fix Implementation**:
- **yaml-sh/yaml-sh.sh:301**: Updated while loop to `while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do` for better error handling
- **yaml-sh/yaml-sh.sh:376**: Removed bash 4+ file descriptor syntax, simplified to use input redirection `done < "$temp_yaml_output"`
- **yaml-sh/yaml-sh.sh:295-298**: Added explicit error checking for temporary file creation

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ All inline list formats now parse successfully: quoted, unquoted, empty, single item, mixed quotes, spaced brackets, large lists (10+ items)
- ✅ Full test suite passes: 164/164 tests
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with existing ticket files

**Additional Fix (2025-07-18)**:
- Fixed issue where inline list items with spaces were being truncated
- **yaml-sh/yaml-sh.sh:327-329**: Added special handling for LIST/ILIST entries to preserve full item content using `cut -d' ' -f3-`
- Created comprehensive test suite test-yaml-inline-lists.sh with 33 test cases covering all edge cases
- Verified fix works in all environments (bash 3.2, 5.1+, Docker Ubuntu/Alpine)
- Updated documentation: yaml-sh/README.md, spec.md, spec.ja.md with bash compatibility information

**Final Status**:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ User confirmed fix works in their Codespaces environment
- ✅ 197 tests passing (including new inline list tests)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Ready for close

## Tasks

- [ ] Analyze failure reasons (environment differences, dependencies, etc.)
- [ ] Fix the root cause of test failures
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass in both local and Docker environments  
- [ ] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions)
- [ ] Run `bash build.sh` to build the project
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

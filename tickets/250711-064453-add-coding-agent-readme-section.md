# Add Coding Agent Documentation to README

## Overview

Create a dedicated section in README files explaining how coding agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) can effectively use ticket.sh for project management. This section should provide clear instructions and best practices for AI assistants working with the ticket system.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add "For Coding Agents" section to README.md
- [ ] Add "For Coding Agents" section to README.ja.md  
- [ ] Include ticket workflow examples for AI assistants
- [ ] Document best practices for ticket creation and management
- [ ] Add examples of how to integrate with existing development workflows
- [ ] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions)
- [ ] Run `bash build.sh` to build the project
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
  - [ ] Update README.*.md
  - [ ] Update spec.*.md
  - [ ] Update DEV.md
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing


## Notes

This documentation should help coding agents understand:
- How to create meaningful tickets for user requests
- Best practices for ticket workflow management
- Integration with existing development processes
- Examples of effective ticket usage patterns

Target audience: AI coding assistants, developers using AI tools, and teams integrating AI into their workflow.

# Enhance Start Command Branch Handling

Improve the `start` command to handle feature branch scenarios more intelligently:

1. When starting on a feature branch with changes: prompt for commit and exit (same as current behavior)
2. When starting on a feature branch with no changes: create feature branch from default branch and switch to it
3. When starting on an existing feature branch: check for differences with default branch and prompt for merge if needed

## Tasks

- [ ] Analyze current start command implementation
- [ ] Add logic to detect feature branch scenarios
- [ ] Implement branch creation from default branch when no changes exist
- [ ] Add merge prompt when starting existing feature branch with differences
- [ ] Test all scenarios thoroughly
- [ ] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions)
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

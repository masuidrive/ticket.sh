# Fix Close Command Cleanup Behavior

## Problem Description

The close command was requiring manual cleanup steps that should have been handled automatically:

1. `git branch -d` fails after squash merge because the branch appears "unmerged"
2. `current-ticket.md` removal was overly conservative, requiring manual deletion
3. Users had to manually run cleanup commands that should be automatic

## Root Cause

- **Squash merge incompatibility**: `git branch -d` requires branches to appear as "merged", but squash merge doesn't show this
- **Overly conservative error handling**: Cleanup failures were stopping essential operations

## Solution

1. Change `git branch -d` to `git branch -D` for squash merge compatibility
2. Remove conditional logic for `current-ticket.md` removal after core workflow completion
3. Simplify cleanup error handling to warnings only

## Tasks

- [x] Analyze close command cleanup issues
- [x] Identify squash merge incompatibility with git branch -d
- [x] Change to git branch -D for proper cleanup
- [x] Remove overly conservative current-ticket.md handling
- [x] Test all scenarios to ensure proper cleanup
- [x] Run tests before closing and pass all tests (No exceptions)
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
  - [ ] Update README.*.md
  - [ ] Update spec.*.md
  - [ ] Update DEV.md
- [ ] Get developer approval before closing

## Impact

**Medium Priority**: Users experienced workflow interruption requiring manual steps, but core functionality worked correctly.

## Verification

- All tests pass (132/132)
- Close command now properly cleans up without manual intervention
- Squash merge workflow works seamlessly
